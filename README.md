# Travel Guru

This is a single page web application made with React. I also used React Router for routing, Bootstrap for layout and styles, Firebase for authentication and Google Maps API.

In this application, user selects a destination first. Then user can read some details about the destination and adjust stay period. Then user has to login with google/email or create an account to book hotels. Destination's map is displayed alongside.
